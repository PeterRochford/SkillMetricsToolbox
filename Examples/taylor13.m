% How to create a Taylor diagram with with no centered RMSD contours
%
% A thirteenth example of how to create a Taylor diagram given one set of
% reference observations and two sets of model predictions for the 
% quantity. This is a variant of example 12, but where the centered RMSD 
% contours are suppressed.
%
% This example shows how to display multiple data sets on the same Taylor 
% diagram where a different color marker is used for each data set to
% identify its source. This is accomplished by overlaying the points from
% the second data set onto the Taylor diagram created using the first data 
% set. Three data sets are used in this example where one is the reference
% and the other two are model predictions. This example also shows how to
% specify the legend using a dictionary instead of a list.
% 
% The data sets are yearly time series for years 2001-2014 comprised of an 
% observation data set and two model predictions. The statistics needed for
% the target diagram have been precomputed and are stored in a data 
% structure. Details on the contents of the data structures (once loaded)
% can be obtained by simply entering the data structure variable name at 
% the command prompt, e.g. 
% >> target_stats1 = 
% 
%   struct with fields:
% 
%      bias: [14×1 double]
%     crmsd: [14×1 double]
%      rmsd: [14×1 double]
%      type: 'unnormalized'
%
% The data in these files are statistics calculated from yearly time series
% of Standard Precipitation Index value over the Mekong basin, a 
% trans-boundary river in Southeast Asia that originates in the Tibetan 
% Plateau and runs through China's Yunnan Province, Myanmar, Laos, 
% Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The data sources are the ERA5 climate 
% reanalysis dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather 
% Forecasts (ECMWF) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM 3B42 
% v7) satellite data, whilst the observation data is the Asian 
% Precipitation - Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards 
% Evaluation (APHRODITE V1801R1) rain-gauge data. All the statistics for 
% the yearly time series are calculated using the observations for 2001 as 
% the reference.
